# r-project-template-and-creator
This includes the template I use for my R projects and the directory-from-template shell script that creates an R project from it. The script names the new project folder based on user input and substitutes the name of the subject of analysis that the user provides into the relevant places for the objects etc.
Changing the two directory variables should allow the script to work as expected.
